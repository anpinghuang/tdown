fetching it does not hog memory, but splitting into chunks and fetching it to improve speech DOES 

does having a GET request make it faster?


literally the way I am streaming it right now is too memory intensive.

I found that ratebypass=yes videos download much faster (usually). 
the videos in the "formats" section instead of "adaptiveformats" included this parameter, so I replaced some videos in adaptive formats with formats.


//// NEXT UPDATE: make it so that you can download the video without it streaming to you


this could be possible solution:
