have faster downloading for MORE videos by decreasing minimum requirement to 1MB and chunksize to 1MB and removed max listeners.  

removed videos with no audio (replaced adaptiveformats with streamingformats)

multiple clients:
1. session id generated on serverside
2. javascript gets sessionId and creates unique websocket connection using sessionId
3. once connection established, client side will send formats and URL. 



if video is unavailable, it will log "video unavavilable" in website.
